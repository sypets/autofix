Autofix provides several commands to perform fixes on an existing TYPO3
installation. This usually repairs something which is broken or can be
improved, due to previous bugs, but also due to suboptimal editing with
low quality control.

Specific to this extension is:

*  the fixes are performed automatically (in contrast to linkvalidator / brofix)
*  the extension does not cover fixes which are already provided by the
   TYPO3 core extension EXT:lowlevel or for example by lolli/dbdoctor
